# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock paper scissors program using javascript

This program is done using the odin project as learning grounds.

This is just a basic javascript program of rock paper scissors done through the console. By calling the function game() the player can then choose rock paper scissors by typing it, case-insensitive, and it will return the result.

The computers choice is made randomly so it changes every time the function is called.

Loop is done.
